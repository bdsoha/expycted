Expycted is a modern, fast, simple to use *expectation pattern* for testing Python 3.7+ code bases.
Simply put, it is just an abstraction over the built-in `assert` keyword, with the following features:

- Use human-readable expectation, allowing you to write your tests like you would a sentence.
- Testing framework independent.
- Plugs into any project as-is.

Expycted's API gained much inspiration from [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect) and [Pest](https://pestphp.com/docs/expectations).
